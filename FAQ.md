# FAQ – Mitomba eSales

###  What happens if a product is out of stock?
Traders can mark a product as sold out, so it disappears from listings.

###  Is my payment secure?
Yes. All payments go through secure mobile money APIs.

###  How long does delivery take?
This depends on trader location. Users get notified of delivery estimate after ordering.

###  Can I cancel an order?
Yes, but only before the trader accepts it. Cancellations are tracked under your account.

###  I’m a trader. Can I see my sales history?
Yes — your dashboard includes sales stats, orders, and customer feedback.
